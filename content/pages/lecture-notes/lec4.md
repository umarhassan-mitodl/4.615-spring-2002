**Concept**

**The Shi&grave;ites:** From shi&grave;a (supporters), who recognized {{% resource_link 26aa7596-7502-fb49-ebfb-97b52a20dedc "&grave;Ali" "#Ali" %}} as the only legitimate imam (political and religious leader) after the Prophet. They developed into several branches which differed primarily in the number of imams they recognized after &grave;Ali. Most important are:Â 

*   _The Twelvers Imamis:_ Who constitute the majority of Shi&grave;ites, and recognize twelve descendants of &grave;Ali as imams.  
    
*   _The Isma&grave;ilis:_ recognize the first six imams as the Twelvers, but differ with them about the seventh, Isma&grave;il, hence their name. 
    

**The Fatimids:** An Isma&grave;ili dynasty whose founder claimed descent from Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet and wife of &grave;Ali, and established a caliphate in Ifriqiya (Tunisia), which was later expanded to include Egypt and southern Syria. 

*   _Al-Mu&grave;izz li-Din Allah:_ (953-75) The fourth Fatimid caliph and the first in Egypt. 
    
*   _Jawhar al-Siqilli:_ The Fatimid general who conquered Egypt and founded al-Qahira.
    

The Great Mosque of Mahdiyya, Tunisia: (ca. 920) Built in the Fatimid new capital, al-Mahdiyya, near Qayrawan, it displays Fatimid monumental additions to a modified hypostyle plan.

**Al-Qahira (Cairo):** The new royal city of Egypt established north of {{% resource_link 26aa7596-7502-fb49-ebfb-97b52a20dedc "Fustat" "#Fustat" %}} by the Fatimids upon their conquest of the country in 969. It had a regular plan running parallel to the Khalij (Canal of the Nile) with a main north-south thoroughfare.

**Majlis:** A T-shaped architectural unit with a large central hall flanked by two smaller spaces. The three spaces are fronted with a portico (riwaq) which opens onto the courtyard via three doors. The type is believed to have been imported from {{% resource_link 26aa7596-7502-fb49-ebfb-97b52a20dedc "Samarra" "#Samarra" %}} to Egypt by Ibn Tulun.

**Fatimid (and pseudo-Fatimid) Palaces:** 

*   _The Eastern Palace:_ (969-72) A huge enclosure with several monumental gates that contained a number of halls set within garden-courtyards.  
    
*   _The Western Palace:_ (975-96) Built by al-&grave;Aziz, al-Mu&grave;izz's son, as the more private caliphal palace across from the Eastern Palace. The two palaces were separated by an open parade ground called Bayn al-Qasrayn (Between the Two Palaces).  
    
*   _La Zisa Palace, Palermo, Sicily_: Built by the Norman king Roger II between 1154-66, it represents the most complete example of a garden pavilion/throne hall built by Muslim craftsmen after the Fatimid model.  
    
*   _La Cuba Palace, Palermo, Sicily_: Attributed to Roger II or his successors and dated to 1180, this palace-pavilion sits within a pool. It too echoes the development in reception hall arrangement in the Fatimid realm.
