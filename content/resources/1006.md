description: 'View of the shaft of the Nilometer at Rawda Island. A water intake built
  716, and rebuilt 861, was used to measure the annual flood level in order to assess
  the taxes to be levied on crops. It consists of a graded marble column in the middle
  of a well connected to the Nile through tunnels dug on three levels topped by a
  light conical dome. The walls of the well are decorated with beautifully carved
  Kufic Qur''anic inscriptions referring to water, prosperity, and vegetation, and
  therefore playing an iconographic role in this crucial structure for the understanding
  of the economic and social history of Egypt. '
