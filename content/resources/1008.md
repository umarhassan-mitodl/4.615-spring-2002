description: Photograph of the mosque of Ibn-Tulun from the North-East. The furthest
  westerly evidence of the spread of the Abbasid imperial style in its decoration,
  its construction material, and its minaret, this mosque is perhaps the most serene
  structure in Cairo. It is distinguished by its brick piers with four engaged brick
  columns on the four sides (a combination of eastern and western influences), its
  angularly spiralling minaret, and its ziyadas, or open extensions which ring it
  on three sides and work as buffers between the streets' bustle and the religious
  space inside.
