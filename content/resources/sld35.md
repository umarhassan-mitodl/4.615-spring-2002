description: Photograph of the shaft of the Nilometer at Rawda Island. A water intake
  built 716, and rebuilt 861, was used to measure the annual flood level in order
  to assess the taxes to be levied on crops. It consists of a graded marble column
  in the middle of a well connected to the Nile through tunnels dug on three levels
  topped by a light conical dome. The walls of the well are decorated with beautifully
  carved Kufic Qur'anic inscriptions referring to water, prosperity, and vegetation,
  and therefore playing an iconographic role in this crucial structure for the understanding
  of the economic and social history of Egypt.
